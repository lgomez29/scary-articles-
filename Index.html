  <p>When I was about 10, we my family of six lived in an extremely small apartment. Two bedrooms upstairs and then the living room. When I was tired of my siblings I would sleep downstairs. One night I am lying on the couch facing the front door and watching the sky through the window by the door when a face shows up in the window illuminated by a lighter. I freeze, and the face goes away. I’m pretty relieved, thinking it was maybe our druggie neighbours seeing if my parents were still awake when it shows up again. I try to scream but when I hope my mouth nothing came out, not a sound. The person then kicks in the door and walks in the room, he sees me, smiles and goes towards the kitchen. As he comes out of the kitchen with a knife my dad makes it down the stairs and the guy boots it out of there. I still can’t sleep easily on couches to this day.</p>
  
  <p>One night when I was maybe 10-12 I had trouble falling asleep. My bedroom was the entire top floor of our house with my bed and such being on the left side and storage closets and a play area being on the right. I was lying in bed when I heard a noise from the other side of the room and see a rocking horse begin to rock. It was sitting just outside one of the storage closet doors. It proceeded to rock its way halfway across the room and stopped dead under the ceiling light. At this point I was freaking out and just buried my head under blankets and never peeked out again until morning.</p>
  
  <p>When I was 17, I went to my mates house for some beers for his Birthday, I probably only had about five drinks. Come the early hours of the morning, probably around 2-3 am, I head out to the kitchen for a drink. I pour a drink of water and turn around and take a sip, and as I’m swallowing I swear I hear footsteps (the ground in the entire room is all made up of tiles), so I hold my drink down and listen for a few seconds. Next thing I know, I hear fast footsteps in front of me running towards me, and suddenly a huge cold breeze blew right through me…at that point, I just freaked out and ran back for the bedroom. I ended up waking my friend up and telling him what happened and we listened and could hear odd bangs and bumps from out there, but nothing out of the ordinary after that ever happened. I’ll still always remember it though, and it even gives me goosebumps writing this.</p>
  
  <p>I had a good friend die when I was 10. We’ll call him Jon. He died pretty tragically too. He was hit by a car literally right in front of my house when he was chasing down a ball that bounced into the road. Fast forward 7 years. I’m babysitting my little sister and she is playing outside. I’m on the porch swing reading and she’s shooting hoops on a little tikes hoop. The ball bounces out into the road and I look up to see her yell, “Don’t go after that ball Jon!!” Freaked the shit out of me. She never even knew about Jon. I asked her who “Jon” was and she said that he would play with her sometimes outside.</p>
  
  <p>So, we're driving from Tijuana to Sonora, late at night. I fall asleep, and wake up hearing my mom say, 'Is that real? How can they drive that way?' and my dad just replying 'I don't know, why would he be driving like this at this hour?'

I opened my eyes a little bit and saw a very creepy school bus in driving in front of us at the middle of the desert with all the windows broken and pieces of plastic all around. 

My parents decided to pass the bus because he was going slower than we were. It was dark so we couldn't see who was driving.

He hit the accelerator and left the creepy bus behind. We waited at a rest stop about 45 minutes for the bus to pass - the road had no turns so you HAD to pass this gas station. It never did.

  <p>I woke up one night having to pee, and I brought my phone to the bathroom. While walking down the hall and texting, I bumped into a girl in a white dress. I didn’t look up, said “sorry,” and kept going. It occurred to me moments later that I was home alone and not in my bustling high school. The next day, when my boyfriend came to pick me up for the movies, he asked why I’d been staring at him through the upstairs window, and why I’d changed out of my white dress. But I don’t even own a white dress.</p>
