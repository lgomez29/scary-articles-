 <p>Our family home was believed by my parents to be haunted or occupied by the spirit of the old widow who passed away there, allowing them to buy the house.

My mother reported hearing her walk up and down our second-floor stairs late at night. Yet the ghost only seemed to be interested in revealing herself to my mother and me, and never to my father, two brothers, or three sisters.

I know it sounds nuts, but it was all too real. She would come up behind me and say, "John..." right in my ear. It was unmistakable, and I could smell, strongly, that old-time lady perfume every time she did that, as well as hearing rustling at my feet, like from an old-time, long dress along the floor.

She would also visit (attack?) me in the night. It was like a heavy, paralyzing weight pinning me to the bed. She was not violent, but scary as hell. There is a lot more, but chew on that for a while.
